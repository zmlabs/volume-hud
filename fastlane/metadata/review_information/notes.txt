Hello App Review Team,

This is a simple utility app that provides a custom on-screen display (HUD) for system volume changes.

To test the app's core functionality, please follow these steps:
1. Launch the application. It will run in the background (you can access its settings from the menu bar icon).
2. Press the volume up or volume down keys on your keyboard.
3. You will see our custom volume HUD appear in the lower-center of the screen, providing a visual feedback. 

The app does not require a login or any special configuration to work.

Thank you for your time!
